IconOverlaying
==============
There were many good talks at NSConference #5, but my favourite one was the one about Flipboard development tools/setup by Evan Doll. One of the things that Evan showed was adding version and commit on top of your icon. Since Flipboard didn't share that I decided to write one, and so I did a day after conference, read more about how I created it at my blog:
